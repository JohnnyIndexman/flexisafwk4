# Days of the Week - Java Program  

## Overview  
This Java program demonstrates the use of an `enum` to represent the days of the week, along with a superclass (`Week`) and a subclass (`WeekDisplay`) to display them.  

## Features  
- Uses an `enum` (`Day`) to define the seven days of the week.  
- Implements **inheritance**, where `WeekDisplay` extends `Week`.  
- Demonstrates **method overriding** by customizing the display method in `WeekDisplay`.  
- Calls the superclass method using `super.displayDays()`.  

## How to Run  
1. Compile the program:  
   ```sh
   javac DaysOfWeek.java
   
   Run the program:
java DaysOfWeek
